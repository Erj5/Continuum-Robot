# Design of Continuous Robot for exploration in the Faculty of Engineering
## Introduction
In the search for innovative solutions for exploration in complex and inaccessible terrain, the design of flexible and continuous robots represents a powerful alternative to traditional robotic structures, which are often limited by their rigidity and lack of adaptability. This project takes as inspiration the structure of the human spine, known for its combination of flexibility and stability, to develop a continuous exploration robot. The structure of the robot is made up of silicone nodes and rigid materials, manufactured using 3D printing, which allow the machine to articulate and adapt to various environments in an agile and efficient manner. Thanks to this hybrid architecture, the robot is capable of avoiding obstacles and modifying its shape, simulating the fluid movement of a spinal column, which is key to carrying out exploration tasks in places that are difficult to access.
## Methodology
### 1. Selection of electronic components and materials:
  * A circuit is implemented to control the continuous robot based on 6 servomotors, 3 joysticks, connection cables, an Arduino and fishing line.
  * To assemble all these materials, a body must be designed capable of incorporating all the components and withstanding the tension that the servomotors will generate in conjunction with the fishing line, which will serve to move the robot.
### 2. Design in Fusion 360:
  * In Fusion 360, a two-level support is created and modeled, which for level one will serve to mount 2 servomotors and the three joysticks, while in the second level it will serve to mount the remaining 4 servomotors.
  * 6 pulleys are created and designed that will be mounted on the 6 corresponding servomotors, through which a piece of fishing line will be wound on each pulley.
  * The rigid nodes of the robot are designed and created, with small "guide" type holes for the fishing line to pass along the continuous robot. Additionally, the final node is designed with the same specifications, but adding a grip that will hold the camera.
  * A mold is designed and created that will be used to make the flexible silicone nodes, which maintain the specifications of the rigid nodes.

### 3. 3D printing:
  * The final design was exported and prepared for printing using the Cura software.
