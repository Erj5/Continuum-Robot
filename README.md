# Design of Continuous Robot for exploration in the Faculty of Engineering
## Introduction
In the search for innovative solutions for exploration in complex and inaccessible terrain, the design of flexible and continuous robots represents a powerful alternative to traditional robotic structures, which are often limited by their rigidity and lack of adaptability. This project takes as inspiration the structure of the human spine, known for its combination of flexibility and stability, to develop a continuous exploration robot. The structure of the robot is made up of silicone nodes and rigid materials, manufactured using 3D printing, which allow the machine to articulate and adapt to various environments in an agile and efficient manner. Thanks to this hybrid architecture, the robot is capable of avoiding obstacles and modifying its shape, simulating the fluid movement of a spinal column, which is key to carrying out exploration tasks in places that are difficult to access.
